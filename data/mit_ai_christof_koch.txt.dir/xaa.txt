"Welcome to the Artificial Intelligence podcast. My name is Lex Friedman. I'm a research scientist at MIT If you would like to skip ahead to the conversation with Christo Co, I start introducing him at about the one minute and 32nd mark. This podcast is an extension of the courses on deep learning autonomous vehicles and artificial general intelligence that have taught and organized. It is not only about machine learning or robotics or neuroscience or philosophy or any one technical field, it considers all these avenues of thought in a way that is hopefully accessible to everyone. The aim here is to explore the nature of human and machine intelligence. The big picture of understanding the human mind and creating echoes of it in the machine. To me, that is one of our civilization's most challenging and exciting scientific journeys into the unknown. I will first repost parts of previous youtube conversations and lecture Q and A's that can be listened to without video. If you want to see the video version, pleas
