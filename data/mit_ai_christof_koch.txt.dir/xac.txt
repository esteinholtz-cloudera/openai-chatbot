le bit and let me ask, do you think there's intelligent life out there in the universe? Uh Yes, I do believe so. We have no evidence of it, but I think the probabilities are overwhelming in favor of it. Given the universe where we have 10 to the 11 Galaxies and each galaxy has between 10 to 1110 to the 12 stars. And we know most stars have one or more planets. So how does that make you feel? It still makes me feel special because I have experiences, I feel the world I experience the world and, uh, independent of whether there are other creatures out there. I still feel the world and I have access to this world in this very strange compelling way. And that's the core of human existence. Now, you said human, do you think if those intelligent creatures are out there, do you think they experience their world, they are evolved, if they are a product of natural evolution as they would have to be, they will also experience their own world. The consciousness isn't just a human. You're right. It's, it's much wider. It
