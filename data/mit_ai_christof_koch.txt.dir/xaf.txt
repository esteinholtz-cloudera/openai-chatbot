nly world, you know, the only world I know, you know, is the world of seeing and hearing voices and touching and all the other things. So it's only much later at early in my unguided days when I became um when I enrolled in physics and in philosophy that I really thought about it and thought, well, this is really fundamentally very, very mysterious and there's nothing really in physics right now that explains this transition from the physics of the brain to feelings, where do the feelings come in? Right. So you can look at the foundational equation of quantum mechanics general relativity, you can look at the period table of the elements. You can, you can look at the endless A TG seat chat in our genes and nowhere is consciousness. Yet I wake up every morning to a world where I have experiences. And so that's the heart of the ancient mind body problem. How do experiences get into the world? So what is consciousness experience, consciousness is any any con any experience? Some people call it subjective feeling.
