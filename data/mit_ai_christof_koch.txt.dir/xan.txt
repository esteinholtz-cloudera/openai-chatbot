 is pure experience. So I recently had this what some people call a mystical experience. I went to Singapore and went into a flotation tank, right? So this is a big tub filled with, with water that's body temperature and absent salt. You strip completely naked, you lie inside of it, you close the the the darkness, complete darkness, soundproof so, very quickly, you become body less because you're floating and you're naked, you have no rings, no watch, no nothing. You don't feel your body anymore. There's no sound soundless. There's no uh photon uh sightless. Timeless because after a while early on, you actually hear your heart. But then that you, you, you sort of adapt to that and then sort of the passage of time ceases. And if you train yourself like in a, in a meditation, not to think early on, you think a lot, it's a little bit spooky. You feel somewhat uncomfortable or you think, well, I'm gonna get bored. But if you try to not to think actively, you become mindless. So there you are body less timeless, y
