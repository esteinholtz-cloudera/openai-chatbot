wing lines between the two. So is there a scientific way to say there's consciousness present in this entity or not and to anticipate your answer? Because you, you will also there's a neurobiological answer. So we can test a human brain. But if you take a machine brain that you don't know, tests for yet, uh how would you even begin to approach a test if there's consciousness present in this thing? OK. That's a really good question. So let me take in two steps. So as you point out for, for, for, for humans, let's just stick with humans. There's now a test called the zap and zip. It's a procedure where you ping the brain using transcranial magnetic stimulation. You look at the electrical reverberations essentially using eg and then you can measure the complexity of this brain response and you can do this in awake people in a sleep, normal people, you can do it in awake people and then anesthetize them, you can do it in patients and it, it, it has 100% accuracy that in all those cases, when you're clear the pati
