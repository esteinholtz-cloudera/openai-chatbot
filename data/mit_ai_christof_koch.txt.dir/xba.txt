also, it's radical difference from experience. And it's very unclear if you build a machine that has a G I, it's not at all, it's not at all clear that this machine will have consciousness, it may or may not. So let's ask it the other way, do you think if you were to try to build an artificial general intelligence system, do you think uh figuring out how to build artificial consciousness would, would help you get to, to an A G I? So, or put another way, do you think intelligent requires consciousness in human? It goes hand in hand in human or I think in biology, consciousness, intelligence goes hand in hand. Quay is illusion because the the brain evolved to be highly complex complexity. Via the theory, integrated information theory is sort of ultimately is, is what is closely tied to consciousness. Ultimately, it's causal power upon itself. And so in eu in evolved systems they go together in artificial system, particularly in digital machines, they do not go together. And if you ask me point blank is Alexa 20
