.0 in the year 2040 when she can easily pass every turing test, she can't just know even if she claims she's conscious. In fact, you could even do a more radical version of this thought experiment. We can build a computer simulation of the human brain. You know what Henry Markham in the blue brain project or the human brain project in Switzerland is trying to do, let's grant him all the success. So in 10 years, we have this perfect simulation of the human brain. Every neuron is simulated and it has alaric and it has motor neurons, it has a, a podcast area and of course they'll talk and they'll say hi. I just woke me up. I feel great. OK. Even that computer simulation that can imprint a map onto your brain will not be conscious. Why? Because it simulates it's a difference between the simulated and the real. So it simulates the behavior associated with consciousness. It might be, it will, if it's done properly, will have all the intelligence that that particular person they're simulating has. But simulating int
