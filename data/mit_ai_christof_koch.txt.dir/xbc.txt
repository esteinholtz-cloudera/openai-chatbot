elligence is not the same as having conscious experiences. And I give you a really nice metaphor that engineers and physicists typically get, I can write down Einstein's field equation nine or 10 equations that describe the link in general relativity between curvature and, and mass. I can do that. I can run this on my laptop to, to predict that the central, the black hole at the center of our galaxy will be so many that it will twist space time around it. So no light can escape. It's a black hole, right? But funny. Have you ever wondered, why doesn't this computer simulation suck me in? Right. It simulates gravity but it doesn't have the causal power of gravity. That's a huge difference. So it's a difference between the real and, and the simulator just like it doesn't get wet inside a computer when the computer runs code that simulates a weather storm. And so in order to have to have artificial consence, you have to give it the same causal power as a human brain. You have to build so called a neuromorphic mac
