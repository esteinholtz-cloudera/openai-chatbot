with is this world that's populated with, with things and images and sounds in your head and touches and all of that. I actually have a question. So, um it sounds like um you kind of have a rich life, you talk about rock climbing and it seems like you really love uh literature. Um Consciousness is all about experiencing things. So, do you think that has helped your research on this topic? Yes, particularly if you think about it, the the various states. So for example, when you do rock climbing or now I do um rowing, cool rowing and a bike every day. You can get into this thing called the zone. And I've always, I wanted, I wanted about, about it particularly with respect to continents because it's a strangely addictive state. You wanna, you wanna, I mean, once people have it, once they want to keep on going back to it and you wonder why, what is it so addicting about it? And I think it's the experience of, of almost close to pure experience because in this, in the zone, you're not conscious of inner voice anym
