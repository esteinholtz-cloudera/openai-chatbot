ore. There's always this inner voice nagging you, right? You have to do this, you have to do that, you have to pay your taxes, you have to fight with your ex and all of those things, they're always there. But when you're in the zone, all of that is gone and you're just in this wonderful state where you're fully out in the world, like you're, you're, you're climbing or you're rowing or biking or, or doing soccer or whatever you're doing and sort of consciousness sort of it is you're all action or in this case of pure experience, you're not action at all.
