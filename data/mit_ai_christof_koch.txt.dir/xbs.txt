christof koch:
every emotion, I feel every eye movement I make. If all of that had to be under the control of consciousness, I couldn't, I, I couldn't, I wouldn't be here. Right. So, so what you do early on your brain, you have to be conscious when you learn things like typing or like riding on a bike. But then what you do, you train up, uh I think that involves gang and strid. You, you train up different parts of your brain and then once you do it automatically like typing, you can show you do it much faster without even thinking about it because you've got these highly specialized what Franz C and I called zombie agents that I can sort of, they're taking care of that while your consciousness can sort of worry about the abstract sense of the text you want to write. And I think that's true for many, many things. But for the things like uh all the fights you had with the ex girlfriend, things that you would think are not useful to still linger somewhere in the subconscious. So that seems like a bug that it would stick there.
