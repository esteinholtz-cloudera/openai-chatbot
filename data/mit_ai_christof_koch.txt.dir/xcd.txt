 once we realize the limits of deep convolutional networks, they can do certain things, but they can't really understand but they don't, they, they don't, they can't really, I can't really show one image I can show you a single image of somebody, a pickpocket who steals a wallet from a purse. You immediately know that's a pickpocket right now. Computer system would just say, well, it's a man, it's a woman. It's a purse, right? Unless you train this machine on showing it 100,000 pickpockets, right? So it doesn't, it doesn't have this easy understanding that you have, right. So, uh, so some people make the, I mean, in order to go to the next step or you really want to build machines that understand in a way you and I we have to go to psychology, we need to understand how we do it and how our brains enable us to do it. And so therefore being on the cusp, it's also so exciting to try to understand better our nature and then to build, to take some of those inside and build them. So I think the most exciting thing
