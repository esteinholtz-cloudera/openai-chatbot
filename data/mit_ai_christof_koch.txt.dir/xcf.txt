o image. And um it has uh it has connection to every cortical region. And Francis Crick. The last paper he ever wrote, he dictated corrections the day he died in hospital on this paper. He now we hypothesize well because it has this unique anatomy. It gets input from every cortical area and projects back to every, every cortical area that the function of this structure is similar. It's just a metaphor to the role of a conductor in a symphony orchestra. You have all the different cortical players, you have some that do motion, some that do theory of mind, some that infer social interaction and color and hearing and all the different modules and cortex. But of course, what consciousness is, consciousness puts it all together into one package, right? The binding problem, all of that. And this is really the function because it has relatively few neurons compared to cortex. But it it it talks it receives input from all of them and it projects back to all of them. And so we are testing that right now, we've got thi
