s beautiful neuron reconstruction in the mouse called crown of thorn crown of thorn neurons that are in the cloud from that have the most widespread connection of any nerve neuron I've ever seen. They're very, you have individual neurons that sit in the cloud from tiny, but then they have this single neurons have this huge axonal tree that cover both IPs and contra cortex and, and trying to turn using, you know, fancy tools like optogenetics, trying to turn those neons on or off and study it. What happens in the, in the mouse. So this thing is perhaps where the parts become the whole, perhaps it's one of the structures. It's a very good way of putting it where the individual parts turn into the whole of the whole of the conscious experience. Well, with that, um Thank you very much for being here today. Thank you very much. Thank you very much."
