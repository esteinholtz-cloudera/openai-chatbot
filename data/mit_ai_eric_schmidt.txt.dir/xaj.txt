oken about the importance of uh thinking five years ahead and having a plan for those five years. And the way to say it is that almost everybody has a one year plan, almost no one has a proper five year plan. And the key thing to having a five year plan is having a model for what's going to happen under the underlying platforms. So here's an example, um, computer Moore's Law, as we know it, the thing that powered improvements in CP US has largely halted in its traditional shrinking mechanism because the costs have just gotten so high. Um It's getting harder and harder, but there's plenty of algorithmic improvements and specialized hardware improvements. So you need to understand the nature of those improvements and where they'll go in order to understand how it will change the platform in the area of network connectivity. What are the gains that are going to be possible in wireless? It looks like there is an enormous expansion of wireless connectivity at many different bands, right? And that we will primarily
