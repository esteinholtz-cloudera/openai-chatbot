, historically, I've always thought that we were primarily going to be using fiber, but now it looks like we're going to be using fiber plus very powerful high bandwidth uh sort of short distance connectivity to bridge the last mile, right. That's an amazing achievement. If you know that, then you're going to build your systems differently. By the way, those networks have different latency properties right, because they're more symmetric um the algorithms feel faster for that reason. And so when you think about whether it's fiber or just technologies in general, so there's this uh Barber wooden poem or quote that I really like, it's from the champions of the impossible rather than the slaves of the possible that evolution draws its creative force. So uh in predicting the next five years, I'd like to talk about the impossible and the possible.
