oday. Those the seminal work there was 20 years ago and in the last 10 years, it's become popularized. So think about the time frames for that level of discovery, it's very hard to predict many people think that we'll be flying around in the equivalent of flying cars. Um who knows my own view. Uh If I want to go out on a limb is to say that when we, we know a couple of things about 50 years from now, we know that there'll be more people alive. We know that we'll have to have platforms that are more sustainable because the earth is, is limited, you know, in the ways we all know and that the kind of platforms that are gonna get built will be consistent with the principles that I've described, they will be much more empowering of individuals. They'll be much more sensitive to the ecology because they have to be, they just have to be. I also think that humans are going to be a great deal smarter and I think they're going to be a lot smarter because of the tools that I've, that I've discussed with you and of cours
