 that characterizes all of them is that they saw the world quicker, faster, they processed information faster. They didn't necessarily make the right decisions all the time, but they were on top of it. And the other thing that's interesting about all those people is they all started young. So think about Steve jobs, started starting Apple roughly at 18 or 19. Think about Bill Gates starting at roughly 2021. Think about by the time they were 30 Mark Zuckerberg, a, a good example at 1920 by the time they were 30 they had 10 years, at 30 years old, they had 10 years of experience of dealing with people and products and shipments and the press and business and so forth. It's incredible how much experience they had compared to the rest of us who are busy getting our phd S. So we we we should celebrate these people because they've just had more life experience and that helps inform the judgment at the end of the day when you're at the top of these organizations, all the easy questions have been dealt with, right?
