have for, you know, we just kind of want to play around with that data and it seems like that's a really nice way to organize this data. Well, I could say I should say what happened, remember is that they were graduate students at Stanford and they thought this is interesting. So they built a search engine and they kept it in their room and they had to get power from the room next door because they were using too much power in the room. So they ran an extension cord over, right? And then they went and they found a house and they had Google World headquarters of five people, right to start the company and they raised $100,000 from Andy Bechtel, who was the sun founder to do this and Dave Cheriton and a few others. The point is their beginnings were very simple, but they were based on a powerful insight that is a replicable model for any start up. It has to be a powerful insight. The beginnings are simple and there has to be an innovation in, in Larry Serge's case. It was page rank, which was a brilliant idea.
