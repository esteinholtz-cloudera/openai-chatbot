ctronics kits, I really did not have enough understanding of sort of electronics to really understand what I was doing. I mean, I could debug it and I could sort of follow the instructions very carefully, uh which has, which has always stayed with me. But I had a very naive model of like how a transistor works. And I, I don't think that that in those days I had any understanding of uh coils and capacitors, which, which actually sort of was a major problem when I started to build more complex digital circuits because I was unaware of the sort of the analog part of the, how they actually work. And I would have things that the scheme, the schematic looked, every, everything looked fine and uh it didn't work. And what I didn't realize was that there was some megahertz level oscillation that was throwing the circuit off because I had a sort of two wires were too close or the switches were uh were kind of poorly built. But through that time, I think it's really interesting and instructive to think about because the
