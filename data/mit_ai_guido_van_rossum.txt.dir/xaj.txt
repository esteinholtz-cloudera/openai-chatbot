 a version of that game for the batch computer we were using where I had a whole pascal program that sort of read an initial situation from input and read some numbers that, that said, do so many generations and print every so many generations and then out would come pages and pages of, of sort of things of different kinds. And, yeah, and I remember much later, I've done a similar thing using Python, but I sort of that original version I wrote at the time I found interesting because I combined it with some trick I had learned during my electronics, hobbyist times. I essentially first on paper, I designed a simple circuit built out of logic gates that took nine bits of input, which is the sort of the cell and its neighbors and produced the new value for that cell. And it's like a combination of, of a half adder and some other clipping, you know, it's actually a full der. And so I had worked that out and then I translated that into a series of bullion operations on pascal integers where you could use the intege
