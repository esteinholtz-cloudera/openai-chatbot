rs as bit wise uh values. And so I could basically generate 60 bits of a generation in, in like eight instructions or so. So I was proud of that. It's, it's funny that you mentioned. So, uh for people who don't know, Conway's game of life is uh there's, it's a cellular automata where there's link, single compute units that kind of look at their neighbors and uh figure out what they look like in the next generation based on the state of their neighbors. And this is deeply distributed uh system that in, in concept at least. And then there's simple rules that all of them follow. And somehow out of this simple rule when you step back and look at what occurs. Uh It, it's beautiful. There's a, an emergent complexity, even though the underlying rules are simple, there's an emerging complexity. Now, the funny thing is you've implemented this and the thing you're commenting on is you're proud of a hack you did to make it run efficiently when you're not commenting on what like this, it's a beautiful implementation. Uh
