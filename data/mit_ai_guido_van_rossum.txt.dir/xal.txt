You're not commenting on the fact that there's an emergent complexity that you've, you've, you've quoted a simple program and when you step back and you print out the following generation after generation, that's stuff that you may have not predicted would happen is happening, right? And there was that is that magic? I mean, that's the magic that all of us feel when we program, when, when you create a program and then you run it and whether it's hello world or it shows something on screen. If there's a graphic component. Are you seeing the magic and the mechanism of creating that? I think I went back and forth as a student, we had an incredibly small budget uh of computer time that we could use, it was actually measured. I once got in trouble with one of my professors because I had overs spent the department's budget. It's a different story. But so I, I actually wanted the efficient implementation because I also wanted to explore what would happen with a larger number of generations and a larger sort of size
