of the, of the board. And so once the the implementation was flawless, uh I would feed a different patterns and then I think maybe there was a follow up article where there were patterns that, that were like gliders, patterns that repeated themselves after a number of generations, but uh translated one or two positions to the right or up or something like that. Uh And there were, I remember things like glider guns. Well, you can, you can Google Conway's game of life. It is still, people still go a and over it for a reason because it's not really well understood why. I mean, this is what Steven Wolfram is obsessed about. Uh He's just the, the, we don't have the mathematical tools to describe the kind of complexity that emerges in these kinds of systems. And you see the only way you can do is to run it. I'm not convinced that that it's sort of a problem that lends itself to, to classic mathematical analysis. And uh so 11 theory of how you create an artificial intelligence or an artificial being is you kind of h
