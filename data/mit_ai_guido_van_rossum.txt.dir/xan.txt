You kinda have to create a universe and let it run that, creating it from scratch in a design way in the, in, you know, coding up a Python program that creates uh a full intelligence system may be quite challenging that you might need to create a universe just like the game of life is. Well, you might have to experiment with a lot of different universes before there, there is a set of rules that doesn't essentially always just end up repeating itself in a, in a trivial way. Yeah. And, and Steve Wolfram, Steven Wolfram who works with these simple rules says that it's kind of surprising how quickly you find rules that create interesting things you shouldn't be able to, but somehow you do. And so maybe our universe is laden with uh with rules that will create interesting things that might not look like humans. But the, you know, emergent phenomena that's interesting may not be as difficult to create as we think. But let me sort of ask at that time, you know, some of the world,
