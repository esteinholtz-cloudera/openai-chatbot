ured out that we're made of atoms, right? And, and, and the same about taking facts as our, our sensory organs, take them in and turning that into reasons and actions. That sort of, there are a lot of abstractions that we haven't quite figured out how to, how to deal with those. I mean, I, so sometimes I don't know if I can go on a tangent or not drag you back in. Sure. So if I take a simple program that parses uh say, say I have a compiler, it parses a program in a sense. The input routine of that compiler of that parser is a sense a sensing organ and it builds up a mighty complicated internal representation of the program. It just saw it doesn't just have a linear sequence of bytes representing the text of the program anymore. It has an abstract syntax tweet and I don't know how many of your viewers or listeners are familiar with compiler technology, but there is fewer and fewer these days, right? Uh That's also true. Probably people want to take a shortcut but they're sort of this abstraction is a data str
