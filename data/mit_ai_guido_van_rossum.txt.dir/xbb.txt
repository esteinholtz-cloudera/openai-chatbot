ucture that the compiler then uses to produce output that is relevant like a translation of that program to machine code that can be executed by, by hardware. And then the data structure gets thrown away when a fish or a fly sees sort of gets visual impulses. I'm sure it also builds up some data structure. And for the fly that may be very minimal. A fly may may have only a few I mean, in the case of a fly's brain, I could imagine that there are few enough layers of abstraction that it's not much more than when it's darker here than it is here. Well, it can sense motion because a fly sort of responds when you move your arm towards it. So clearly, it's visual processing is intelligent. Well, not intelligent but it has an abstraction for motion. And we still have similar things in, in but much more complicated in our brains. I mean, otherwise you couldn't drive a car if you, if you couldn't, if you didn't have an incredibly good abstraction for motion. Yeah. In some sense, the same abstraction for motion is prob
