 neural networks, which is a type of machine learning that you feed a bunch of data and that neural network learns to do a function. All you specify is the inputs and the outputs you want and you can't look inside, you can't analyze it. All you can do is train this function to map the inputs to the outputs by giving a lot of data in that sense. Programming becomes getting a lot of cleaning, getting a lot of data. That's what programming is. Uh in this, there would be programming 2.02 0.022 0.0 and I wouldn't call that programming. It, it's just a different activity just like building organs out of cells is not called chemistry. Well, so let, let's just uh let's just step back and think sort of more generally, of course. But you know, it's like uh as a parent teaching, teaching your kids things can be called programming in that same sense that that's how program is being used. You're providing them data examples uh use cases. So imagine writing a function not by uh not with four loops and uh clearly readable t
