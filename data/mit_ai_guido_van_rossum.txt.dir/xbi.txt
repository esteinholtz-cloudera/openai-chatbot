So that's the 2.0 concept. And so the question I have for you is like, it's a very fuzzy way. This is the reality of a lot of these pattern recognition systems and so on. It's a fuzzy way of quote unquote programming. What do you think about this kind of world should be called something totally different than programming? It, it's like if you're a software engineer, does that mean you're, you're designing systems that are very, can be systematically tested. Yeah, evaluated.
