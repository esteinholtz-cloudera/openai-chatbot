researched this conversation, went back to ABC and it looks remarkably, it, it has a lot of annoying qualities. Uh but underneath those like all caps and so on, uh But underneath that there's elements of Python, they're quite, they're already there. That's where I got all the good stuff, all the good stuff. So, but in that world you're swimming, these programming languages, were you focused on just the good stuff in your specific circle or did you have a sense of what, what is everyone chasing you said um that every programming language is uh built to scratch an itch. Were you aware of all the itches in the community and if not, or if, yes, I mean, what it were you trying to scratch with Python? Well, I'm glad I wasn't aware of all the itches because I would probably not have been able to do anything. I mean, if you're trying to solve every problem at once, you saw nothing. Uh, well, yeah, it's, it's too overwhelming and so I had a very, very focused problem. I wanted a programming language that set somewhere
