times the task just demands it. And well, I would say most of the time the task actually demands a certain language because the task is not write a program that solves problem X from scratch. But it's more like fix a bug in existing program X or add a small feature to an existing large program. Uh But even if, if you sort of, if you're not constrained in your choice of language by context like that, uh there is still the fact that if you write it in a certain language, then you sort of OK, you, you have this balance between how long does it time, does it take you to write the code? And how long does the code run? And when you're in sort of in the phase of exploring solutions, you often spend much more time writing the code than running it. Because every time you've sort of, you've run it, you see that the output is not quite what you wanted and you spend some more time coding. Uh and a language like Python just makes that iteration much faster because there are fewer details. There is a large library. Uh sort
