 of, there are fewer details that, that you have to get right before your program compiles and runs. Uh There are libraries that do, do all sorts of stuff for you. So you can sort of very quickly take a bunch of existing components, put them together and uh get your prototype application running. Just like when I was building electronics, I was using a bread board most of the time. So I, I had this like sprawl out circuit that if you shook it, it would stop working because it was not put together very well, but it functioned and all I wanted was to see that it worked and then move on to the next, next schematic or design or add something to it. Once you've sort of figured out, oh, this is the perfect design for my radio or light sensor or whatever, then you can say, OK, how do we design a PC B for this, how do we solder the components in a small space? How do we make it so that it is robust against uh say voltage fluctuations uh or mechanical uh disruption? I mean, I know nothing about that when it comes to d
