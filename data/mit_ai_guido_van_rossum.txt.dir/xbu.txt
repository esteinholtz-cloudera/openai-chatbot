esigning electronics, but I know a lot about that when it comes to, to writing code. So the initial, the initial steps are uh efficient, fast and there's not much stuff that gets in the way. But you're kind of describing um from uh like Darwin described the evolution of species, right? You, you, you're observing of what is about true about Python. Now, if you take a step back, if the art of if the act of creating languages is art and you had three months to do it, initial steps. So you just specified a bunch of goals, sort of things that you observe about Python, perhaps you had those goals. But how do you create the rules, the syntactic structure, the, the features that result in those? So I have in the beginning and I have follow up questions about through the evolution of Python too. But in the very beginning when you're sitting there creating uh the, the lexical analyser or whatever evolution was still a big part of it because I, I sort of, I said to myself, I don't want to have to design everything from
