scratch. I'm going to borrow features from other languages that I like. So you exactly, you first observe what you like. And so that's why if you're 17 years old and you want to sort of create a programming language, you're not going to be very successful at it because you have no experience with other languages. Whereas I was in my, let's say, mid thirties, uh I had written parcels before. So I had worked on the implementation of ABC. I had spent years debating the design of ABC with its authors. It's with its designers, I had nothing to do with the design. It was designed fully as it was ended up being implemented when I joined the team. But so you borrow ideas and concepts and very concrete sort of local rules from different languages like the indentation and certain other syntactic features from ABC. But I chose to borrow string literals and how numbers work from C and, and various other things. So and then if you take that further, so yet you've had this funny sounding, but I think surprisingly accurate
