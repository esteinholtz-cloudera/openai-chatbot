me just because in the interest of time too because I have a few cool questions for you. I mean, let's touch a really important one because it was quite dramatic and beautiful in certain kinds of ways. Uh In July this year, three months ago, you wrote now that pep 572 is done. I don't ever want to have to fight so hard for a pep and find that so many people despise my decisions. I would like to remove myself entirely from the decision process. I'll still be there for a while as an ordinary core developer and I'll still be available to mentor people, possibly more available. But I'm basically giving myself a permanent vacation from being BDFL uh benevolent dictator for life and you all will be on your own. First of all, just this, it's uh it's almost Shakespearean. I'm not going to appoint a successor. So what are you all going to do? Create a democracy anarchy, a dictatorship, a federation. So that was a very dramatic and beautiful, a set of statements. It's almost, it's open ended nature called the community
