opeful that Python will develop into a sort of high concurrency, high parallelism language. That's sort of the, the way the language is designed, the way most users use the language, the way the language is implemented all make that a pretty unlikely future. So you, you think it might not even need to really the way people use it. It, it it might not be something that should be of great concern. I think Ay IO is a special case because it sort of allows overlapping IO and only IO and that is, is a sort of best practice of supporting very high throughput IO many connections per second. Uh I'm not worried about that. I think async IO will evolve. There are a couple of competing packages, we have some very smart people who are sort of pushing us in sort of to make AYN co better uh parallel computing. I think that Python is not the language for that. Uh There are there are ways to work around it, but you sort of, you can't expect to write an algorithm in Python and have a compiler automatically paralyze that. What
