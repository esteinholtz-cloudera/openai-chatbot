 you can do is use a package like numpy. And there are a bunch of other very powerful packages that sort of use all the CP US available because you tell the package, here's the data, here's the abstract operation to apply over it, go at it and then, then we're back in the C++ world. But the those packages are themselves implemented usually in C++. That's right. That's, that's where tensor flow and all these packages come in where they paralyze across GP us. For example, they take care of that for you. So in terms of packaging, uh can you comment on? Yeah, packaging has always been my least favorite topic. It's, it's, it's a really tough problem because uh the Os and the platform want to own packaging. Uh But their packaging solution is not specific to a language. Like if you take Linux, there are two competing packaging solutions for Linux or for UNIX in uh in general. And but they all work across all languages and several languages like node javascript uh and Ruby and Python all have their own packaging solu
