 out all the time, right? But you can solve it with data. If you write a program that does the money hall, you know game and then never switches and always switches, just compare. You would immediately see that you don't have to be smart, right? You don't have to figure out the answer algorithmically. You can just brute force it out with data and say, well, I know the answer is this because I ran the program a billion times and these are the data buckets that I got from it, right? So empirically find it. But what's the joy of that? What, what so for you, for you personally uh outside of family, what motivates you in this process? Well, to be honest, like I don't really write a lot of code anymore. Like what I do at discourse is like manage stuff which I always kind of despised, right?
