 could happen to that person. You know, something, you know, there's a lot of variables. So like at first when you think about leadership have, have multiple people doing leadership and have them talk amongst each other. So giving each other feedback about the decisions that they're making. And then when you do get feedback, I think there's that little voice in your head, right? Like, or your gut or wherever you want to put it in your body. Uh I think that voice is really important. Like, I think most people who have any kind of moral compass or like want to do, most people want to do the right thing. I do believe that, I mean, there might be a handful of sociopaths out there that don't, but most people, they want other people to think of them as a good person. And why wouldn't you? Right. Like, do you want people to despise you? I mean, that's just weird. Right? So you have that little voice, that sort of the angel and devil on your shoulder, sort of talking to you about like what you're doing, how you're do
