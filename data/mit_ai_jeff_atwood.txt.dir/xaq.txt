It was stuff that we allowed early on that we eventually decided wasn't allowed such as what's your favorite programming food? You know, what's the funniest programming cartoon you've seen? Uh And we had to sort of backfill a bunch of rules about like, why isn't this allowed? Such as is this a real problem you're facing? Like, nobody goes to work and says, wow, I can't work because I don't know what the funniest programming cartoon is. So sorry, can't compile this code now, right? It's not a real problem you're facing in your job. So that was run rule. And the second like, what can you really learn from that? It's like what I call accidental learning or reddit style lear
