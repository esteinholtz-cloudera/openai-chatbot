m I love the style of the founder. I just love the, the design ethic and there's a lot to like about Tesla. I know if you saw the Oatmeal, he did a whole love comic to Tesla and it was actually kind of cool because I learned some stuff he was talking about how great Tesla cars were specifically, like how they were built differently. And he went into a lot of great detail. That was really interesting. And to me that oatmeal post, if you read it is the genesis of pretty much all interest communities. I just really love this stuff. So for me, for example, there's Yo Yos, right? Like I'm into the Yo Yo communities and there's these interest communities are just really fascinating to me and I feel more connected to the Yo Yo communities than I do to, you know, friends that I don't see that often, right? Like to me, the powerful thing is the interest graph and Facebook kind of dabble in the interest graph. I mean, they have groups, you can sign up for groups and stuff, but it's really about the relationship graph.
