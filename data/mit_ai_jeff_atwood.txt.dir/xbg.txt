dest problem in computer science is coming with a good name for stuff, right? Um But there you can go back to my, there's the poll where we voted and stack overflow became the name of the site. And all the early beta users of stack overflow were were audience of my blog plus Joel's blog, right? So we started from like if you look at the Genesis, OK? I was just a programmer who said, hey, I love programming, but I have no outlet to talk about it. So I'm just going to blog about it because I don't have enough people to work to talk to about it because at the time I worked a place where, you know, programming wasn't the core output of the company it was a pharmaceutical company and I just love this stuff, you know, to an absurd degree. So I was like, I'll just blog about it and then I'll find an audience and eventually found an audience. Eventually found Joel and eventually build stack overflow from that one core of, of activity, right? But it was that repetition of feeding back in feedback from my blog comments
