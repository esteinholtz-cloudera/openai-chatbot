know, I i it's not a free, that stuff doesn't come for free, right? It's not like we, we all have perfect answers and nobody will have to get their feelings hurt or nobody will have to get down voted like that. It doesn't work that way, right? Like, so this is an interesting point on a small tangent. Yeah, you write about anxiety. Uh So I, I've posted a lot of questions and written answers on stack overflow. And the question I usually go to something very specific to something I'm working on. This is something you talk about that really, the goal of stack overflow isn't about is to write a question. Not that's not about you. It's about the question that will help the community in the future. But that's a tough sell, right? Because people are like, well, you know, I don't really care about the community. What I care about is my problem, my problem and that's fair, right? It's sort of that again, that tension that balancing act of we want to help you, but we also want to help everybody that comes behind you, ri
