ve people because that was never really the the audience that we were designing stack over for. That doesn't mean it's wrong. And I think it would be awesome if there was a site like that on the internet or if Stack overly said, hey, you know, we're gonna start doing this. That's fine too. You know, I'm not there. I'm not making those decisions. But I do think the pressure of the tension that you described is there for people to be. Look, I'm a little nervous because I know I gotta do my best work, right? The other one is something you talk about, which is also really interesting to me is duplicate questions or do it's a, it's a really difficult problem that you highlight super, super hard, like you could take one little topic and you could probably write 1020 30 ways of asking about that topic and there will be all different. I don't know if there should be one page that answers all of it. Is there a way that stack overflow can help disambiguate, like separate these duplicate questions or connect them togeth
