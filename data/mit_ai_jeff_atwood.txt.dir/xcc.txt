er? Or is it a totally hopeless, difficult impossible task? I think it's a very, very hard computer science problem and partly because people are very good at using completely different words. It always amazed me on psych overflow, you'd have two questions that were functionally identical and one question had like zero words in common with the other question like, oh my God from a computer science perspective, how do you even begin to solve that? And it happens all the time. People are super good at this, right? Accidentally at asking the same thing in in like in 1020 different ways. And the other complexity is we want some of those duplicates to exist. Because if there's five versions with different words, have those five versions point to the one set, centralized answer, right? It's like, OK, this is duplicate. No, no worries. This, here's, here's the answer that you wanted over here on this, this, this, you know, the, the prime example that we want to have, um rather than having 10 copies of the question a
