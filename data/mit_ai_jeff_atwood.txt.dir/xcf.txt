uper strict because strictness is correct. No, it's no, no strictness produces better results. That's what I'm saying, right. So strict typing of variables, I would say you almost universally have consensus now is basically correct. Should be that way in every language, right? Duck equals five should generate an error because you know, you didn't declare, you didn't tell me that duck was an edger, right? That's a bug, right? Or maybe you miss type you type deck, right? Instead of duck, right? You never know this happens all the time, right? So with that in mind, I will say that the strictness of the system is correct. Now, that doesn't mean cruel.

So I have a theory that if you're in a job and you work with assholes all day long, wha
