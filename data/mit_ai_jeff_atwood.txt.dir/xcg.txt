t do you eventually become an asshole? And what is the computer except the world's biggest asshole? Because the computer has no time for your bullshit. The computer, the minute you make a mistake, everything is crashing down, right? One semicolon has crashed space missions, right? So that's normal. So you begin to internalize that you begin to think, oh, my coworker, the computer is super strict and kind of a jerk about everything. So that's kind of how I'm gonna be because I work with this computer and I have to accede to its terms on everything. So therefore you start to absorb that and you start to think, oh, well, being really strict arbitrarily is really good. An error of error code 56249 is a completely good error message because that's what the computer gave me, right? So you kind of forget to be a person at some level and you know how they say great detect internalize criminals and kind of are criminals themselves like this trope of the master detective is good because you can think like the criminal.
