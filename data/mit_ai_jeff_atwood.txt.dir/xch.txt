 Well, I do think that's true of programmers, really good programmers think like the computer because that's their job. But if you internalize it too much, you become the computer and you kind of become a jerk to everybody because that's what you've internalized. You're almost not a jerk, but you have no patience for lack of strictness. As you said, it's not out of a sense of meanness. It's accidental, but I do believe it's an occupational hazard of being a programmer is you start to behave like the computer. You're very unforgiving. You're very terse, you're very, oh, wrong, incorrect move on. It's like, well, can you help me? Like, what could I do to fix? No wrong next question, right? Like that's normal for the computer, right? Just fail next, right? Like, I don't know if you remember in Saturday Night Live, like in the nineties they had this character who was an it guy. The move. Move. Move was that Jimmy Fallon? No, no. Who played him? Um OK. Yeah, I remember move. He had no patience for it. TV, actually
