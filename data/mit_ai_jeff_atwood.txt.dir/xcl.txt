mming over the past, what is it 15 years really? Of being a public figure? I, I would say the big insight that I had is eventually as a programmer, you have to kind of stop writing code to be effective, which is kind of disturbing. Um because you really love it and but you realize like being effective at programming at programming in the in the general sense, uh doesn't mean writing code. And a lot of times you can be much more successful by not writing code and writing code in terms of just solving the problems, you have essentially hiring people that are really good and like setting them free and like giving them basic direction, right? Like on strategy and stuff because a lot of the problems you encounter aren't necessarily solved to like really gnarly code, they're solved by conceptual solutions which can then be turned into code. But are you even solving the right problem? I mean, so I I would say for me, the main insight I have is is is to succeed as a programmer, you eventually kind of stop writing cod
