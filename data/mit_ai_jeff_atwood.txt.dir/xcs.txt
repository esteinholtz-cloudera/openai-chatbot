 a prototype. Let's iterate on the prototype really, really rapidly. And that's what we do with discourse and that's what we, we demoed to get our, our seed funding for discourse was the, the alpha version of discourse um that we had running and ready to go and it was very, it was bad. I mean, it was, I'll just tell you it was bad. Um I have, we have screenshots of it and I'm just like embarrassed to look at it now. Um But it was the prototype, we were figuring out like what, what's working, what's not working because there's such a broad gap between, between um the way you think things will work in your mind or even on paper and the way they work once you sit and live in the software, like actually spend time living and breathing on software so different. So my philosophy is get to uh a prototype and then what you're really optimizing for speed of iteration, like how you can turn the crank, how quickly can we iterate? That's the absolutely critical metric of any software project. And I had a tweet recently t
