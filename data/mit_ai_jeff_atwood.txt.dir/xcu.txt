ike, well, you're dead, like you can't iterate, you can't, how you can do anything. Right. Like, so anyway, about the heartbeat, it's like get the, the, the prototype and then iterate on it. That's, that's what I view as like the central tenet of modern software development. That's fascinating. You put it that way. It's actually, so I work in, I build autonomous vehicles and, and when you look at what uh maybe compare Tesla to most other automakers, uh the psych, the whatever the heartbeat for Tesla is literally days. Now, in terms of they can um over the air deploy software updates to all their vehicles, which is markedly different than every other automaker, which takes years to update a piece of software. And so, uh and that's reflected in everything that's um the, the final product that's reflected in really how slowly they adapt to the times and to be clear, I'm not saying being a hummingbird is the goal either. It's like you don't want a heartbeat, that's like so fast. It's like you're, you're, you know
