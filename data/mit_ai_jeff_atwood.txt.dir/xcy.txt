ur work. Like just, just basic soft. The bed literal bedrock of software development is source control. Now you compare today like github, right? Like Microsoft bought github, which I think was incredibly smart acquisition, move on their part. Now they have anybody who wants like reasonable source controls to go send them on github. It's all set up for you, right? There's tons of walkthroughs, tons of tutorials. So from the concept of like has programming advanced from say 1999 it's like, well, hell we have github, I mean, my God, yes. Right. Like it's, it's massively advanced over over what it was now as to whether programming is significantly different. Um I'm going to say no, but I think the baseline of like what we view as like fundamentals will continue to go up and actually get better like source control. For example, that's one of the fundamentals that has gotten, I mean, hundreds of orders of magnitude better than it was 1020 years ago. So those are the fundamentals. Let me introduce two things that m
