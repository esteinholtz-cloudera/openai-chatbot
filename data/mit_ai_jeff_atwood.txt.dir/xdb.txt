al programming that's going to happen. Um, I, I just, I don't know, I've, I've, over time, I've become a believer in that UNIX philosophy of just, you know, they, they kind of had to write with UNIX that's going to be the way it is for a long, long time. And we, we'll continue to, like I said, raise the baseline, the tools will get better, it'll get simpler, but it's still fundamentally going to be command line tools, you know, fancy Ds, that's kind of it for the foreseeable future. I'm not seeing any visual programming stuff on the horizon because you kind of think like, what do you do on a smartphone that will be directly analogous to programming? Like I'm trying to think, right? Like, and there's really not much so uh not necessarily analogous to programming, but the kind of things that the kind of programs you need to write might need to be very different and the kind of languages, I mean, but I probably also subscribe to the same just because everything in this world might be written in javascript. Uh Oh
