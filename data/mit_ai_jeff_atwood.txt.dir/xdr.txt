just cool keyboard like, oh my God, this look really cool. Right? Like that's like how many keyboards this guy have? It's kind like me with yo yos. How many yo do you have? How many do you need? Well, technically one, but I like a lot. I don't know why. So, same thing with keyboard. So, yeah, they're awesome. Like I highly recommend anybody that doesn't have a mechanical to research it, look into it and see what you like. And you know, it's ultimately a fetish item. But I think these sort of items, these religious artifacts that we have are part of what makes us human like that. That part is important, right? It kind of makes life worth living. It's not necessary in the strictest sense, but ain't nothing necessary if you think about it, right? Like so, yeah, why not? So sure, Jeff? Thank you so much for talking today. Yeah, you're welcome. Thanks for having me."
