sations interesting moving forward. This podcast will be long form conversations with some of the most fascinating people in the world who are thinking about the nature of intelligence. But first, like I said, I will be posting old content. But now in audio form for a little while, I'll probably repeat this intro for reposted youtube content like this episode and we'll try to keep it to what looks to be just over two minutes, maybe 230. So in the future, if you want to skip this intro, just jump to the 2 30 minute mark in this episode, I talked with Max Tegmark. He's a professor at mit, a physicist who has spent much of his career studying and writing about the mysteries of our Cosmological universe. And now thinking and writing about the beneficial possibilities and existential risks of artificial intelligence. He's the co founder of the Future of Life Institute, author of two books, Our Mathematical Universe and Life 3.0 he is truly an out of the box thinker. So I really enjoyed this conversation. I hope yo
