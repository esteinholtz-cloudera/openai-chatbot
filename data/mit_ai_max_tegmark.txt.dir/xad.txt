ng telescopes and, and computers? My guess is no, actually the the probability of it happening on any given planet, there's some number, we don't know what it is. And um what we do know is that uh the number can't be super high because there's over a billion earth like planets in the milky way galaxy alone, many of which are billions of years older than earth. And um aside from some um UFO believers, now, there isn't much evidence that any super civilization has come here at all. And so that's the famous Fermi paradox, right? And then if you, if you work the numbers, what you find is that um if you have no clue what the probability is of getting life on a given planet, so it could be 10 to the minus 1010 to the minus 20 or 10 to the minus two or any power of 10 is sort of equally likely if you want to be really open minded, that translates into it being equally likely that our nearest neighbor is 10 to the 16 m away, 10 to the 17 m away. 10 to the 18. Now, by the time he gets much less than, than 10 to 16 alr
