sing anything and it's not the interesting thing about the consciousness that gives us this amazing subjective experience of colors and sounds and emotions and so on is rather something at the higher level about the patterns of information processing. And that's why I, that's why I like to think about this idea of Perceptron. And what does it mean for an arbitrary physical system to be conscious in, in terms of what its particles are doing or, or, or its information is doing? I don't think I don't I hate carbon chauvinism. You know, this attitude, you have to be made of carbon atoms to be smart or or conscious or something about the information processing this kind of matter performs. Yeah. And you know, you can see I have my favorite equations here describing various fundamental aspects of the world. I feel that I think one day maybe someone who's watching this will come up with the equations that that information processing has to satisfy to be conscious. I'm quite convinced there is big discovery to be mad
