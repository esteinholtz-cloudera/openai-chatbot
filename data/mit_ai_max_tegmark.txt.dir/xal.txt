e an unresponsive patient coming in, wouldn't it be great? If in addition to having AC T scanner, you had a consciousness scanner that could figure out whether this person is actually having locked in syndrome or is actually comatose and in the future, imagine if we build robots or the machine that we could have really good conversations with, I think it is most very likely to happen. Right. Wouldn't you want to know, like if your home help, a robot is actually experiencing anything or just like a zombie? I mean, would you prefer it? What would you prefer? Would you prefer that it's actually unconscious so that you don't have to feel guilty about switching it off or giving boring chores or what, what would you prefer?
