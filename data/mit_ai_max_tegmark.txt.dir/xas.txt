f embodiment of self to want to preserve? Well, now we're getting a little bit anthropomorphic anthropomorphizing things, maybe talking about self preservation instincts. I mean, we are evolved organisms, right? So Darwinian evolution endowed us and other of all the organism with a self preservation instinct because that was that didn't have those self preservation genes got cleaned out of the gene pool, right? Um But if you build an artificial general intelligence, the mind space that you can design is much, much larger than just a specific subset of minds that can evolve that have. So they, so an A G I mind doesn't necessarily have to have any self preservation instinct. It also doesn't necessarily have to be so individualistic as us. Like, imagine if you could just, first of all, or we are also very afraid of death. You know, I suppose you could back yourself up every five minutes and then your airplane is about to crash. You're like shucks. I'm just, I'm, I'm gonna lose the last five minutes of experience
