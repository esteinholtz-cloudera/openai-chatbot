 then that doesn't, there's no reason that has to be years, it can be in principle much faster and uh the time scale of future progress in A I and also all of science and technology will will be driven by machines, not humans. So it it's this point, simple point which this gives right, this incredibly fun controversy about whether there can be intelligence explosion, so called singularity as we inch called it. Now, the idea is articulated by IJ good is obviously way back fifties, but you can see Alan Turing and others thought about it even earlier app. So you asked me, what exactly would I define human level as? So this the the glib answer is is to say something which is better than us at all cognitive tasks with a better than any human at all cognitive tasks. But the really interesting bar I think goes a little bit lower than that. Actually, it's when they can, when they're better than us at A I programming and, and, and a general learning so that they can, can if they want to get better than us at anything
