rst of all, I know they're all like your Children. But like which one is that the master key of quantum mechanics of the micro world? So this with this equation, we can check like everything to do with atoms, molecules and all the way up to. Yeah. So OK, so quantum mechanics is certainly a a beautiful mysterious formulation of our world. So I'd like to sort of ask you just as an example, it perhaps doesn't have the same beauty as physics does. But in mathematics uh abstract, the Andrew Wiles who proved the FMA last theory. So I, he I just saw this recently and it, it kind of caught my eye a little bit. This is 358 years after it was, it was conjectured. So this very simple formulation, everybody tried to prove it, everybody failed. And so here's this guy comes along and eventually proves it and then fails to prove it and then proves it again in 94. And he said like the moment when everything connected into place that in an interview, he said it was so indescribably beautiful that moment when you finally reali
