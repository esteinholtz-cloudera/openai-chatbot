coveries I made, I later realized that they had been discovered earlier by someone who sometimes got quite famous for it. So I i it's too late for me to even publish it, but that doesn't diminish in any way the emotional experience you have when you realize it like. Wow. Yeah. So what would it take in that, that moment? That, wow, that was yours in that moment. So what do you think it takes for an intelligence system? An A G I system, an A I system to have a moment like that. That's a tricky question because there are actually two parts to it, right? One of them is Kenneth accomplish that proof. You cannot prove that you can never write A to the N plus B to the N equals three to that equals Z to the end for all integers, et cetera, et cetera. When, when N is bigger than two, that, that's simply in the question about intelligence. Can you build machines that are that intelligent? And I, I think by the time we get a machine that can independently come up with that level of proofs, probably quite close to a G I.
