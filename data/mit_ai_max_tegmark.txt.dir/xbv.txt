e is something with the power to process information in the way that we human beings do that's out there that um that needs to be sort of connected to it seems a little bit philosophical perhaps, but there's something compelling to the idea that the power is already there, which is the focus should be more on the, on being able to communicate with it. Well, I agree that the, in some, in a certain sense, the hardware processing power is, is already out there because our universe itself, you can think of it as being a computer already. Right. It's constantly computing what water waves, how it evolved the water waves and the river char and how to move the air molecules around that. Seth Lloyd has pointed out my colleague here that you can even in a very rigorous way, think of our entire unive as, as being a quantum computer. It's pretty clear that our universe supports this amazing processing power because you can even within this physics computer that we live in, right? We can even build actual laptops and stuf
