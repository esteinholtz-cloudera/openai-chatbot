f. So clearly the power is there. It's just that most of the compute power that nature has, it's in my opinion, kind of wasting on boring stuff like simulating yet another ocean wave somewhere where no one is even looking, right? So in a sense of what life does, what we are doing when we build computers is we're weanling all this compute that nature is doing anyway, into doing things that are more interesting than just yet another ocean wave, you know, and let's do something cool here. Uh So the raw hardware power is there for sure. But, and, and, and even just like computing what's going to happen for the next five seconds in this water bottle, you know, it takes a ridiculous amount of compute if you do it on a human computer, this water bottle just did it. But that does not mean that this water bottle has a G I and this, because a G I means it should also be able to like have written my book, done this interview. And I don't think it's just communication problems. I don't think it can do it. And, and althou
