ut the promise limitations of this piece? Right. The the I I think there are a number of of of very important insights, very important lessons we can always draw from these kind of successes. One of them is when you look at the human brain, you see it's very complicated, 10 to 11 neurons. And there are all these different kinds of neurons and yada yada. And there's been this long debate about whether the fact that we have dozens of different kinds is actually necessary for intelligence. We can. Now, I think quite convincingly answer that question of no, it's enough to have just one kind. If you look under the hood of alpha zero, there's only one kind of neuron and it's ridiculously simple, simple mathematical thing. So it's, it's not the, it's just like in physics, it's not if you have a gas with waves in it, it's not the detailed nature of the molecule of matter. It's the collective behavior somehow. And similarly, it's, it's it's this higher level structure of the network that matters, not that you have 20
