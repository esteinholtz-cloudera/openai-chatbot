And, uh, evolutionarily attainable in patches and so on. So, I, I think it's pretty, my, my hunch is that we're going to understand how to build a G I before we fully understand how our brains work. Just like we, we understood how to build flying machines long before we were able to build a mechanical word, bird. Yeah, that's right. You've given the, you're given that the example exactly of mechanical birds and airplanes and airplanes do a pretty good job of flying without really mimicking bird flight.
