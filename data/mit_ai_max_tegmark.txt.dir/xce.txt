hink it might be the same there. That's one lesson. Uh a another lesson which is more what, what our paper was about first. We, we, I, I as a physicist thought it was fascinating how there's a very close mathematical relationship actually between our artificial neural networks and a lot of things that we've studied for in physics go by nerdy names, like the renormalization group equation and Hamiltonians and yada, yada yada. And, and um when you look a little more closely at this, you have, um at first I was like, well, there's something crazy here that doesn't make sense because we know that if you even want to build a super simple neural network to tell the park cat pictures and dog pictures, right? That you can do that very well now. But if you think about it a little bit, you convince yourself it must be impossible. Because if I have one megapixel, even if each pixel is just black or white, there's two to the power of 1 million possible images, there's way more than their atoms in our universe, right? So
