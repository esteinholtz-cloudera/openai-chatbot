in order to, and then for each one of those, I have to assign a number which is the probability that it's a dog, right? So an arbitrary function of images is a list of more numbers than there are atoms in our universe. So clearly, I can't store that under the hood of my, my GP U or my, my computer yet somehow works. So what does that mean? Well, it means that the out of all of the problems that you could try to solve with a neural network, almost all of them are impossible to solve with a reasonably sized one. But then what we showed in our paper was was that the the fraction, the kind of problems, the fraction of all the problems that you could possibly pose that, that we actually care about given the laws of physics is also an infinitesimally tiny little part. And amazingly, they're basically the same part. Yeah, it's almost like our world was created for, I mean, they kind of come together. Yeah. But you could say maybe where the world created the world that the world was created for us. But I have a more
