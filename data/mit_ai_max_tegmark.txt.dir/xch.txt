you can do it, but you're gonna need two to the power of 1000 neurons to multiply 1000 numbers, which is again, more neurons than there are atoms in our universe. So that's what I'm saying. But if you're allowed, if you allow yourself, make it a deep network of many layers, you only need 4000 neurons, that's perfectly feasible. So that's really interesting. Yeah. So on another architecture type, I mean you mentioned Schroeder's equation and what, what are your thoughts about quantum computing and the role of this kind of um computational unit in creating an intelligence system in some Hollywood movies that I will not mention my name because I don't want to spoil them the way they get a G I is building a quantum computer because the word quantum sounds cool. And so on my first of all, I think we don't need quantum computers to build a G I I suspect your brain is not quantum computer in an a found sense. So you don't even wrote a paper about that many years ago. I calculated the decoherence so called decoherenc
