e time that how long it takes until the quantum computers of of what your neurons are doing gets erased by just random noise from the environment. And it it's about 10 to the minus 21 seconds. So as cool as it would be to have a quantum computer in my head, I don't think that fast, you know, on the other hand, there are very cool things you could do with quantum computers or I think we'll be able to do soon when we get big, one, bigger ones that might actually help machine learning do even better than the brain. So for example, one, this is just a Moonshot. But um, hey, uh you know that, that learning, it's very much same thing as search if, if you have a, if you're trying to train a neural network to get really learned to do something really well, you have some lost function. You have some, you have a bunch of knobs, you can turn represented by a bunch of numbers and you're trying to tweak them so that it becomes as good as possible at this thing. So if you think of a landscape with, with some valley where e
