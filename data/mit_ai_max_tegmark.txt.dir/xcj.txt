ach dimension of the landscape corresponds to some number you can change, you're trying to find the minimum. And it's well known that if you have a very high dimensional landscape, complicated things, it's super hard to find the minimum, right? Quantum mechanics is amazingly good at this. Like if I want to know what's the lowest energy state, this water can possibly have incredibly hard to compute, but we we can but nature will happily figure this out for you. If you just cool it down, make it very, very cold. If you put a ball somewhere, it'll roll down to its minimum. And this happens metaphorically at the energy landscape too. And, and quantum mechanics even use some little some clever tricks which today's machine learning systems don't like if you're trying to find the minimum and you get stuck in the little local minimum here in quantum mechanics, you can actually tunnel through the barrier and get unstuck again. And, and um that's really interesting. Yeah. So it, so it may, for example, we one day use q
