ng as the Nihilists have said, f knowing the meaning of life is beyond our cognitive capabilities, as Steven Pinker said, based on my interpretation 20 years ago and g none of the above uh I'd say aid comes closest, but I would amend that to attaining not only knowledge but uh fulfillment more generally. That is life, health stimulation, uh access to the uh living cultural and social world. Now, this is our meaning of life. It's not the meaning of life. Uh If you were to ask our genes, uh that their meaning is to propagate copies of themselves. But that is distinct from the meaning that the brain that they lead to sets for itself.

We want to experience beauty, we want to experience the, the richness of the natural world. But uh understanding the what makes the universe tick is uh is, is way up there for some of us more than others. Uh Ce
