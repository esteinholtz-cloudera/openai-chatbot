now. But putting that aside, put aside that, that largely philosophical question. The question is uh is there some difference between the hu human neural network and the ones that we we're building in in artificial intelligence will mean that we're on the current trajectory not going to reach the point where we've got a lifelike robot indistinguishable from a human because the way their neural so called neural networks are organized are different from the way ours are organized. I think there's overlap. Um But I think there are some, some big differences that uh their current neural networks, current so-called deep learning systems are, are in reality, not all that deep that is they are very good at extracting high order statistical regularities. But most of the systems don't have a semantic level, a level of uh actual understanding of who did what to whom uh why, where, how things work, what causes, what else do you think that kind of thing can emerge as it does? So, artificial neurons are much smaller, the
