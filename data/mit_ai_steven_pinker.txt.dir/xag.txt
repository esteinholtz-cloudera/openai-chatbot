number of connections and so on than the current human biological networks? But do you think sort of go to go to consciousness or to go to this higher level semantic reasoning about things? Do you think that can emerge with just a larger network with a more richly weirdly interconnected network separate again consciousness because conscious isn't even a matter of complex. Really weird one. Yeah, you could have, you could, you could sensibly ask the question of whether shrimp are conscious, for example, they're not terribly complex, but maybe they feel pain. So let's, let's just put that one, that part of it aside. But uh uh I, I think sheer size of a neural network is not enough to give it uh structure and knowledge. But if it's suitably engineered, then uh then, then why not? That is we're neural networks, natural selection did uh a kind of equivalent of engineering of our brains. So I don't think there's anything mysterious in the sense that no uh no system of silicon could ever do what a human brain can do
