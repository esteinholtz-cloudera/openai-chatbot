. I think it's possible in principle, whether it'll ever happen depends not only on how clever we are in engineering these systems, but whether even we even want to, whether that's even a sensible goal that is, you can ask the question, is there any um locomotion system that is uh as as good as a human? Well, we kind of wanna do better than a human ultimately in terms of legged locomotion. Uh uh There's no reason that humans should be our benchmark. They're, they're tools that might be better in some ways. It may just be not as uh it may be that we can't duplicate a natural system because uh at some point, it's so much cheaper to use a natural system that we're not going to invest more brain power and resources. So, for example, we don't really have a subs an exact substitute for wood. We still build houses out of wood. We still build furniture out of wood. We like the look. We like the feel. It's wood has certain properties that synthetics don't. It's not that there's anything magical or mysterious about woo
