een spec special purpose uh A I and so called general IA I is relevant that in the same way that special purpose A I is not going to do anything conceivable in order to attain a goal, all engineering systems have to uh are, are designed to trade off across multiple goals. When we build cars in the first place, we didn't forget to install brakes in because the goal of a car is to go fast. Uh It occurred to people. Yes, you want to go fast but not always. So you, you, you build in brakes too. Likewise, if a car is going to be uh autonomous, that doesn't and program it to take the shortest route to the airport, it's not gonna take the diagonal and mow down people and trees and fences because that's the shortest route. That's not what we mean by the shortest route when we program it. And that's just what an, uh, an intelligence system uh is, by definition, it takes into account multiple constraints. The same is true. In fact, even more true of so called general intelligence. That is, if it's genuinely intelligent
