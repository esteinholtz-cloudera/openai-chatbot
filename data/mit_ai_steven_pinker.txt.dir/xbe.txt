ink you're very well positioned as an engineer to remind people about the culture of engineering that it really is uh safety oriented that another discussion in Enlightenment. Now, uh I plot uh rates of accidental death from various causes, plane crashes, uh car crashes, uh occupational accidents, even death by lightning strikes. And they all plummet. Uh because the culture of engineering is how do you squeeze out the uh the the lethal risks, death by fire, death by drowning, uh death by asphyxiation, all of them drastically declined because of advances in engineering that I gotta say I did not appreciate until I saw those graphs and it is because ex exactly people like you who stay up at night think, oh my God, it is. What am I? What am I what I'm inventing? Likely to hurt people and to deploy ingenuity to prevent that from happening. Now, I'm not an engineer, although I spent 22 years at MIT. So I, I know something about the culture of engineering. My understanding is that this is the way, this is the way y
