ist that most psychologists are familiar with, came up with the idea that human memory has a capacity of uh seven plus or minus two chunks. That's probably his biggest claim to fame. But he wrote a couple of books on language and communication that I read as an undergraduate again, beautifully written and uh intellectually deep. Wonderful Steven. Thank you so much for taking the time today. My pleasure. Thanks a lot, Lex."
