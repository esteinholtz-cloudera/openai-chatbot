ere, that means that you're realist. So you're trying to really understood, understand that God thought. So the way you see the world is as an instrumentalist, you know, I working for some models, models of uh machine learning. So in this model, we can see uh second and they try to solve, resolve the setting to solve the problem. And you can do it in two different ways from the point of view of instrumentalist. And that's what everybody does now because uh they say the goal of machine learning is to uh find the rule for classification that is true but it is instrument for prediction. But I can say the God of uh machine learning is to, to learn about conditional probability. So how God played use and he is he play, what is probability for one? What is probability for another given situation? But for prediction, I don't need this, I need the rule, but for understanding, I need conditional probability. So let me just step back a little bit first to talk about you mentioned uh which I read last night, the the par
