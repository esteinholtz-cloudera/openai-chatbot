y carefully look on all equations which define conditional probability, you can understand something about reality more than from your fantasy. So math can reveal the simple underlying principles of reality. Perhaps, you know what means simple. It is very hard to discover them. But then when you discover them and look at them, you see how beautiful they are. And and it is surprising why people did not see that before you're looking on equation and derive it from equations. For example, I talked yesterday about le square and people had a lot of fantasy have to improve li square net. But if you look going step by step by solving some equations, you suddenly you get some term which after thinking, you understands that it describes position of observation point in li we met, we throw out a lot of information. We don't look in composition of point of observations. We looking only on residuals. But when you understood that, that's very simple idea, but it's not too simple to understand. And you can derive this just
