 form a coherent so some simple algebra, a few steps will take you to something surprising that when you think about and that is proof that human intuition not too rich and very primitive. And it does not seem very simple situations. So let me take a step back in general. Yes. Right. Uh But what about human as opposed to intuition, ingenuity? Um moments of brilliance? So, are you, so do you have to be so hard on human intuition? Are there moments of brilliance in human intuition that can leap ahead of math and then the math will catch up? I don't think so. I think that the, the best human intuition it is putting in axioms and then it is technical where where the axioms take you. But if they correctly take axioms, but it Axion polished during generations of scientists and this is integral wisdom. So that's beautifully put. But if you maybe look at when you, when you think of Einstein and uh Special relativity, yeah, what is the role of imagination coming first there in the moment of discovery of an idea? So th
