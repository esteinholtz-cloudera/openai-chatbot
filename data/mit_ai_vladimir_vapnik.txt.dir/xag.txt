ere's obviously a mix of meth and out of the box imagination there that I don't know whatever I did, I exclude any imagination because whatever I saw in machine learning that come from imagination like features like deep learning. They are not really the problem. When you're looking very carefully from mathematical equations, you're deriving very simple theory which goes far beyond theoretical than whatever people can imagine because it is not good fantasy, it is just interpretation, it is just fantasy, but it is not what you need. You don't need any imagination to derive uh say main principle of machine learning. When you think about learning and intelligence, maybe thinking about the human brain and trying to describe mathematically the process of learning. Uh that is something like what happens in the human brain. Do you think we have the tools currently? Do you think we will ever have the tools to try to describe that process of learning? You, it is not descriptions of what's going on. It is interpretatio
