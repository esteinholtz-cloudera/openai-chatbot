rive from this, that it is relevant to say seem like it. Yeah. So, but underneath, in order for us to understand swims like a duck, it feels like we need to know millions of other little pieces of information we pick up along the way you don't think. So there doesn't need to be this knowledge base in, in those statements carries some rich information that helps us understand the essence of duck. How far are we from integrating uh predicates? You know that when, when you consider complete. So machine learning, so what it does you have a lot of functions and then you, you're, you're talking, it looks like the duck. You see your training data from training data, you recognize it like uh expect it d should look, then you remove all functions which does not look like you think it should look from time and date. So you decrease the amount of function from DP, you pick up one, then you give a second predicate and again, dec decrease the set of function. And after that, you, you pick up the best function you can find
