vladimir vapnik:
 it is standard machine learning. So why you need not too many examples because your predicates aren't very good. You're not such music, a predicate, very good because every predicate is invented to decrease ALEAS set of function. So you talk about admissible set of functions and you talk about good functions. So what makes a good function? So admissible set of function is sort of function which is small capacity or small diversity, small VC dimension which contain good function. So by the way, for people who don't know VC, um you're the V in the VC. Uh uh So uh how would you describe to a layperson what GC theory is, uh how would you describe these mushroom so machine capable to pick up one function from the admissible set of function? But a set of admissible function can be big. They contain all continuous functions and uses. You don't have so many examples to pick up function but it can be small, small. Uh we call it capacity but maybe better called diversity. So not very different function in the set is i
