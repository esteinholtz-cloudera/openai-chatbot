nfinite set of function but not very diverse. So it is small VC dimension. When DC dimension is small, you need not, you, you need a small amount of training data. So the goal is to create admissible set of functions which is have small VC dimension and contain good function. Then you should then you will be able to pick up the function uh using a small amount of observations. So that is the task of learning is creating a set of admissible functions that has a small VC dimension. And then you figure out a clever way of picking up no, that that is goal of learning which I formulated yesterday. Statistical learning theory does not involve in creating admissible set of function in classical learning theory everywhere. 100%. In textbook, the set of function admissible set of function is given. But this is science about nothing because the most difficult problem to create admissible set of functions given say a lot of functions continuum set of function create admissible set of functions. That means that it kills
