finite VC dimension, small VC dimension and contain good function. So this was out of consideration. So what's the process of doing that? I mean, it's fascinating what is the process of creating this um admissible set of functions? That's the various, can you describe the various of pro of training data? And uh proper just means that you uh have some function and you, you, you just count what is value average value function and training data you have model and what is the expectation of this function on the model? And they should coincide. So the the problem with both have to pick up functions, it can be any function it uh in in in fact, it, it it is true for all functions. But because when you're talking said, say duck does not jumping. So you don't ask questions, jump like a duck because it is trivial. It does not jumping and doesn't help you to recognize you. But you know something, each question to ask if you're asking, it seems like a, like a duck but looks like a duck at his general situation looks like
