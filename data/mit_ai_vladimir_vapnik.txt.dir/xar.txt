at. Nobody knows what's going on in the brain. So I think the more reliable look on mass, this is mathematical problem. Do your best to solve this problem. Try to understand that there is not only one way of convergence, which is strong way of convergence. There is a weak way of convergence which requires predicate. And if you will go through all this stuff, you will see that you don't need deployment even more. I would say one of the theorem which called to represent that theory. It says that optimal solution of mathematical problem, which is, which described learning his own shadow network not on deep loading and a shallow network. Yeah, the problem is there. Absolutely. So in the end, what you're saying is exactly right, the question is you have no value for throwing something on the table playing with it, not math. So like in your own network where you said throwing something in the bucket and or the biological example and looking at kings and queens with the cells with the microscope, you don't see value
