 interpretation. The fact is a neural network system doesn't matter. A learning system that we don't, I think mathematically understand that well, beats the best human player does something that was thought impossible, which means that it's not a very difficult problem that that's so you empiric, we empirically have discovered that this is not a very difficult problem. Yeah, it's true. Uh So maybe can't argue. Uh So even more, I would say that if they use the planning, it is not the most effective way of learning the and usually when people use deep learning, they're using zillions of training data. OK. Yeah, but you don't need this. So I describe challenge. Can we do some problems which do well, deep learning method, this deep net are using 100 times less training data even more. Some problems deep learning cannot solve because it's not necessary they create admissible set of function. When they to create deep architecture means to create admissible set of functions. You cannot say that you are creating good
