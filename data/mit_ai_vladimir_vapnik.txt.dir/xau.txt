 admissible set of functions. You just it's your fantasy, it does not come from mass, but it is possible to create admissible set of functions because you have your training data that actually for mathematicians. Uh When you considering variant, you need to use law of large numbers. When you're making training in existing algorithm, you need uniform law of large numbers, which is much more difficult, you see dimension and all this stuff. But nevertheless, if you use balls big stroke way of convergence, you can decrease a lot of training data. You could do the three that swims like a duck and quacks like a duck. But our, so let, let's step back and um think about intel human intelligence in general and clearly that has evolved in a non mathematical way. It wa it wasn't uh as far as we know God uh or, or, or whoever didn't come up with a model um and place in our brain of admissible functions that kind of evolved, I don't know, maybe you have a view on this. But so Alan touring in the fifties in his paper asked
