 and rejected the question. Can machines think is not a very useful question? But can you briefly entertain this useful useless question. Can machines think so, talk about intelligence and your view of it? I don't know that I know the imitation. If computer can imitate human being, let's call it intelligent. And he understands that it is not thinking computer. He he completely understand what he done, but he set up problem of imitation. So now we understand that the problem not in imitation. I am not sure that intelligence just inside of us, it might be also outside of us, I have several observations. So when they prove some sodium, it's very difficult sodium. Uh in a couple of years in several places, people prove the same theory I'm saying. So dilemma after us was done, then other guys proved the same in the history of science. It's happened all the time. For example, geometry, it's happened simultaneously first did Levski and then Gaus and Boy and other guys and it approximately in 10 times period, 10 year
