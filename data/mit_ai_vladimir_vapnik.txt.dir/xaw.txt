s, period of time. And I saw a lot of examples like that and many mathematicians think that when they develop something, they develop something in general which affect everybody. So maybe our models of intelligence only inside of us is incorrect. It's our interpretation. It may be there exist some connection, you're almost like plugging in into uh and contributing to this network into a big maybe in your network. On the flip side of that, maybe you can comment on a big old complexity and how you see classifying algorithms by worst case running time in relation to their input. So that way of thinking about functions, do you think P equals NP? Do you think that's an interesting question? Yeah, it is an interesting question. But let me talk about complexity in about worst case scenario. There is a MA MA setting when they came to United States in 1990. So people did not know this is the, they did not know statistical learning. So in Russia, it was published to monographs or monographs. But in America, they did no
