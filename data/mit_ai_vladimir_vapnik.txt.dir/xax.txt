t know then they learned and somebody told me that it is worst case theory and they will create a real case theory. But till now, it did not because it is much, much too you can do only what you can do using the markets and which has a clear understanding and clear description. And for this reason, he introduced complexity and you need this because using actually it is divers like this one more this dimension, you can prove some theorem. But we also create the for case when you know probability measure and that is the best case it can happen in this entropy theory. So from a medical point of view, you know the best possible case, the worst possible possible case you can derive different model in me medium. But it's not so interesting. You think the edge, the edges are interesting, the edges is interesting because it is not so easy to get good bond, exact bolt. It's not many cases where you have the bot is not exact but interesting principles. You discover the mass. Do you think it's interesting because it's c
