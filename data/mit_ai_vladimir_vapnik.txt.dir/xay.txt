hallenging and reveals interesting principles that allow you to get those bounds? Or do you think it's interesting because it's actually very useful for understanding the essence of a function of a of an algorithm. Uh So it's like me judging your life. As a human being by the worst thing you did and the best thing you did versus all the stuff in the middle, it seems uh not productive. I don't think so because you cannot describe situation in the middle or it will be not general. So you can describe age cases and it is clear it has some model but you cannot describe model for every new case. So you, you'll be never accurate when you're using. But from a statistical point of view, the way you've studied uh functions and, and the nature of learning and the world, don't you think that the real world has a very long tail that the cases are very far away from the mean, the the stuff in the middle or no, I don't know that because I think that but from my point of view, if you will use formal statistic uniform law of
