t quickly. But that last slide was a powerful open challenge and a formulation of the essence, this exact problem of dig because everybody when machine learning started, it was developed by, they immediately recognized that we use much more uh training data than human needed. But now again, we came to the same story have to decrease. And that is the problem of learning. It is not like in deep learning, they, they use zillions of training data because maybe zillion are not enough. If you um have a good uh invariance, maybe you will never collect some number of observations. But now it is a question to, to intelligence have to do that because statistical part is ready. As soon as you supply us, we predicate, we can do a good job with a small amount of observations. And the very first challenges will know digital recognition and you know, digits. And please tell me in variants. I think it's about that. I can say for digit three, I would introduce concept of horizontal symmetry. So the the digit three has horizon
