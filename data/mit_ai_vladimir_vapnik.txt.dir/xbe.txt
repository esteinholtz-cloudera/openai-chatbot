tal symmetry say more than say digital or something like that. But as soon as I get to the horizontal symmetry, I can mathematical invent a lot of measure of horizontal symmetry on the vertical symmetry or the oral symmetry, whatever if I have a idea of symmetry. But what else looking on on on digit? I see that it is me, me predicates which is not shape. It is something like symmetry like half dark is whole picture, something like that which which can rise a predicate. You think such a predicate could rise out of something that's um not general meaning it feels like for me to be able to understand the difference between a two and a three, I would need to have had a a childhood of 10 to 15 years playing with kids, going to school, being yelled by parents, all of that wa walking, jumping looking at ducks and now then I would be able to generate the right predicate for telling the difference between two and a three. Or do you think there's a more efficient way? I know for sure that you, you must know something m
