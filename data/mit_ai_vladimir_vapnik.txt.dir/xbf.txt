ore than digits that's a powerful but maybe there are several languages of description um this elements of digits. So I talking about symmetry about some properties of geometry are talking about something abstract. I don't know that but this is a problem of intelligence. So in one of our article, it is trivial to show that every example can carry not more than one bit of information in real. Because uh when you show example, uh and you say this is one, you can remove, say a function which does not tell you one, say it's the best strategy. If you can do it perfectly, it's remove half of the one. But when you use one predicate, which looks like a duck, you can remove much more function than half. And that means that it contains a lot of information from a formal point of view. But when you have a general picture of what you want to recognize a general picture of the world, can you invent this predicate and that predicates Ky a lot of information. Beautifully put maybe just me. But in all the math you show in yo
