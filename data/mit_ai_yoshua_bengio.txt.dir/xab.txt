on't know how biological neural networks do but would be really useful for artificial ones is the ability to do credit assignment through very long time. Spans. There are things that we can in principle do with artificial neural nets, but it's not very convenient and it's not biologically plausible. And this mismatch, I think this kind of mismatch maybe an interesting thing to study, to a understand better how brains might do these things because we don't have good corresponding theories with artificial neural nets. And B maybe provide new ideas that we could explore about um things that brain do differently and that we could incorporate in artificial neural nets. So let's break credit assignment up a little bit. It's a beautifully technical term, but it could incorporate so many things. So, is it more on the R and N memory side that thinking like that or is it something about knowledge building up common sense knowledge over time? Or is it more in the reinforcement learning sense that you're picking up rewar
