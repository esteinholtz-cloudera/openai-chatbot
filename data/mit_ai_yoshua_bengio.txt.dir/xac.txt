ds over time for a particular to achieve a certain kind of goal? So I was thinking more about the first two meanings whereby we store all kinds of memories, um episodic memories in our brain, which we can access later in order to help us both infer causes of things that we are observing now and assign credit to decisions or interpretations. We came up with a while ago when you know those memories were stored and then we can change the way we would have uh reacted or interpreted things in the past. And now that's created assignment used for learning. So in which way do you think artificial neural networks, the current LSTM, the current architectures are not able to capture the presumably you're thinking of very long term. So current recurrent nets are doing a fairly good job for sequences with dozens or say hundreds of time stamps. And then it gets sort of harder and harder and depending on what you have to remember and so on, as you consider longer durations, whereas humans seem to be able to do credit assign
