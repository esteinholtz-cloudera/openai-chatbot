elationships between causes and effects. Um the sort of objective functions which could be important to allow the the the the highest level uh explanations to to to rise from from the learning, which I don't think we have now the kinds of objective functions which could be used to uh reward exploration, the right kind of exploration. So these kinds of questions are neither in the dataset nor in the architecture, but more in how we learn under what objectives and so on. Yeah, that's uh I've I've heard you mention in several contexts, the idea of sort of the way Children learn, they interact with objects of the world. And it seems fascinating because uh in some sense, except with some cases in reinforcement learning. That idea is not part of the learning process in uh artificial neural networks. So it's almost like, do you envision something like uh an objective function? Saying, you know what if you poke this object in this kind of way, it would be really helpful for me to further further learn, sort of almost
