 guiding some aspect of learning. So I was talking to Rebecca Sachs just an hour ago and she was talking about lots and lots of evidence from uh infants seem to clearly pick what interests them in, in a directed way. And so they're not passive learners, they, they focus their attention on aspects of the world which are most interesting, surprising in, in a nontrivial way that makes them change their theories of the world. So uh that's a fascinating view of the future progress. But on a a more maybe boring question, do you think going deeper? And so do you think just increasing the size of the things that have been increasing a lot in the past few years will also make significant progress? So some of the representational issues that you mentioned, they're kind of shallow in some sense in the sense of abstraction, in the sense of abstraction, they're not getting some. I don't think that having more, more depth in the network in the sense of instead of 100 layers, we have 10,000 is going to solve our problem. Yo
