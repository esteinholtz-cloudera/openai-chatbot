u don't think so is that obvious to you. Yes. What is clear to me is that engineers and companies and labs and grad students will continue to tune architectures and explore all kinds of tweaks to make the current state of the art slightly ever slightly better. But I don't think that's going to be nearly enough. I think we need some fairly drastic changes in the way that we're considering learning to achieve the goal that these learners actually understand in a deep way, the environment in which they are uh you know, observing and acting. But I guess I was trying to ask a question that's more interesting than just more layers is basically once you figure out a way to learn through interacting, how many parameters does it take to store that information? So I think our brain is quite bigger than most neural networks. Oh I see what you mean. I'm with you there. So I agree that in order to build neal nets with the kind of uh broad knowledge of the world that typical adult humans have probably the kind of competing
