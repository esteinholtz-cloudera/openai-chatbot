 power we have now is going to be insufficient. So the good news is there are hardware companies building neal net chips and so it's going to get better. However, the good news in a way, which is also a bad news is that even our state of the art, deep learning methods fail to learn models that understand even very simple environments like some grid worlds that we have built even these fairly simple environments. I mean, of course, if you trim them with enough examples, eventually they get it. But it's just like instead of what, instead of uh what humans might need, just uh dozens of examples, these things will need millions, right? For very, very, very simple tasks. And so I think there's an opportunity for academics who don't have the kind of computing power that say Google has um to do really important and exciting research to advance the state of the art in um training frameworks, learning models, uh agent learning in even simple environments that are synthetic, that seem trivial. But yet current machine l
