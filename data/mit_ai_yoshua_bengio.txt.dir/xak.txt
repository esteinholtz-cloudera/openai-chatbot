earning fails on, we talked about priors and common sense knowledge. It seems like uh we humans take a lot of knowledge for granted. Uh So what's your view of these priors of forming this broad view of the world, this accumulation of information and how we can teach neural networks or learning systems to pick that knowledge up. So knowledge, you know, for a while the artificial intelligence was maybe in the like there's a time where knowledge representation, knowledge acquisition, expert systems, I mean, the symbolic A I was, was a view was an interesting problem set to solve and it was kind of put on hold a little bit, it seems like because it doesn't work, it doesn't work. That's right. That's right. But the goals of that remain important, yes, remain important. And how do you think those goals can be addressed?
