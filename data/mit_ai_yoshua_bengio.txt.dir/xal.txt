There's something really powerful that comes from distributed representations, the thing that really makes neal nets work so well. And it's hard to replicate that kind of power in a symbolic world, the knowledge in, in expert systems and so on is nicely decomposed into like a bunch of rules. Whereas if you think about a neural net, it's the opposite, you have this big blob of parameters which work intensely toge
