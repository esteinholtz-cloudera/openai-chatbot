 about. And and I still think this is important, but I think this is missing out on a very important ingredient which classical A I systems can remind us of. So let's say we have these, this integral representation. You still need to learn about the the relationships between the variables, those high level semantic variables, they're not going to be independent. I mean, this is like too much of an assumption they're going to have some interesting relationships that allow to predict things in the future, to explain what happened in the past, the kind of knowledge about those relationships in a classical A I system is encoded in the rules. Like a rule is just like a little piece of knowledge that says, oh I have these 234 variables that are linked in this interesting way. Then I I can say something about one or two of them given a couple of others, right? In addition to disentangling the the elements of the representation, which are like the variables in a rule based system, you also need to disentangle the the
