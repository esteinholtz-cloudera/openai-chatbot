ch other and not just the variables that are disentangled from each other. And you draw a distinction between semantic space and pixel like does there need to be an architectural difference or? Well, yeah, so, so there's the sensory space like pixels which where everything is entangled, the, the, the the the information like the variables are completely interdependent in very complicated ways and also computation like the the it's not just the variables, it's also how they are related to each other is is all intertwined. But, but I I'm hypothesizing that in the right high level representation space, both the variables and how they relate to each other can be disentangled. And that will provide a lot of generalization power generalization power distribution of the test set is assumed to be the same as the distribution of the training set, right? This is where current machine learning is too weak. It it it doesn't tell us anything is not able to tell us anything about how are, you know, let's say are going to g
