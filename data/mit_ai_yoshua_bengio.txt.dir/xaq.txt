eneralize to a new distribution and, and you know, people may think well, but there's nothing we can say if we don't know what the new distribution will be. The truth is uh humans are able to generalize new distributions. Yeah. How are we able to do that? So because there is something these new distributions, even though they could look very different from the trending distributions, they have things in common. So let me give you a concrete example. You read a science fiction novel, the science fiction novel, maybe, you know, brings you in some other planet where things look very different on the surface, but it's still the same laws of physics, right? And so you can read the book and you understand what's going on. So the distribution is very different. But because you can transport a lot of the knowledge you had from earth about the underlying cause and effect relationships and physical mechanisms and all that and maybe even social interactions, uh you can now make sense of what is going on on this planet w
