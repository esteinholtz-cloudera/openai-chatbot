out X machina as a movie because I, I actually watched it for the second time and enjoyed it. I hated it the first time and I enjoyed it quite a bit more the second time when I sort of learned to accept uh certain pieces of it. Uh, see, see it as a concept movie, how, what was your experience? What what what were your thoughts? So the negative is the picture it paints of science is totally wrong. Science in general and A I in particular science is not happening uh in some hidden place by some really smart guy, one person, one person, this is totally unrealistic, this is not how it happens. Even a team of people in some isolated place will not make it. Science moves by small steps. Thanks to the collaboration and um community of a large number of people interacting. And um all the scientists who are experts in their field kind of know what is going on, even in the industrial labs, it's information flows and leaks and so on and, and the spirit of it is very different from the way science is painted in this movi
