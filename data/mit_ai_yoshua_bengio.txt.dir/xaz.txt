For example, how humans react emotionally. Uh I would say the simplest thing is unfair situations which trigger anger. This is one of the most basic emotions that we share with other animals. I think it's quite feasible within the next few years. So we can build systems that can detect these kind of things to the extent.

So you can imagine like a video game where agents interact in, in some ways and then some situations trigger an emotion.
