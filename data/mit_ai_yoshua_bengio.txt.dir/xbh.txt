ing because it doesn't have to be with rewards. It could be in all kinds of ways that an agent is learning about its environment. Now, reinforcement learning you're excited about. Do you think, do you think Gans could provide something? Yes, a moment in, in games or other jar of models I believe will be crucial ingredients in building agents that can understand the world. A lot of the uh successes in reinforcement learning in the past has been with uh policy gradient where you, you just learn a policy, you don't actually learn a model of the world. But there are lots of issues with that. Um And we don't know how to do model based RL right now, but I think this is where we have to go in order to build models that can generalize faster and better like to new distributions um that capture to some extent at least the underlying causal mechanisms in the world. Last question, what made you fall in love with artificial intelligence if you look back, what was the first moment in your life when you s, when you were fa
